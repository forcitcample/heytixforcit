Include Me helps to include any external file (textual, HTML or PHP) in posts or pages.

== Description ==

Include Me helps to include in posts or pages external files usually to be shared
between different posts or pages or that contains PHP or other code that can be
compromised by the visual editor.

The use is immediate: the shortcode [includeme] is all that you need (see the documentation
on [Include Me official page](http://www.satollo.net/plugins/include-me)).

The best way to use it is to include functionalities
written in external PHP that will be rendered in post body or to include pieces of
javascript that will be hard to add with WordPress editor.

Inclusions can be rendered with IFRAME if needed to create boxes that display
external web pages.

This plugin is made of few line of code, ultralite!
