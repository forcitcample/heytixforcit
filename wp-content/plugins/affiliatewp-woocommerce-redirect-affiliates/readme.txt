Redirect affiliates to their affiliate area when they login via WooCommerce's /my-account page

== Description ==

This plugin requires both [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") & [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/ "WooCommerce"). <strong>It will NOT function without them.</strong>

Once installed and activated, your Affiliates will be redirected to their affiliate area, rather than the /my-account page that WooCommerce provides.

There's a affwp_wc_redirect filter if you wish to redirect affiliates to another location upon logging in.
