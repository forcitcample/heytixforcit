WooCommerce extension for creating simple product bundles, kits and assemblies.

== Description ==

Product bundling is one of the most effective marketing strategies: Bundle a few products together, sell them at a discount price and watch the sales go up! However, product bundling is not all about boosting sales: Product grouping is a very common way to create complex products, product kits or assemblies that consist of multiple parts. Often, these parts may need to be stock-managed individually, bundled in multiples, or even be entirely optional.

Product Bundles is probably the most straightforward WooCommerce extension for creating simple product packages: With Bundles you can quickly build complex products and create bulk discount combos by mixing simple and variable products. Downloadable and virtual products are also supported, while Product Bundles support many popular WooCommerce extensions, such as Product Add-ons, Subscriptions and Composite Products.
