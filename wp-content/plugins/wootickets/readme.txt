WooCommerce Tickets allows you to sell tickets to The Event Calendar events using WooCommerce.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Tickets allows you to create and sell tickets to your The Events Calendar/Events Calendar PRO-powered events. Integrating seamlessly with WooCommerce - which is required along with The Events Calendar to run this plugin - WooCommerce Tickets gives you the power to keep ticket sales contained entirely within your site. This means no more sending buyers to a third-party portal or requiring an outside solution like Eventbrite if you don't want to. And it allows you to take advantage of many of the powerful features already built into WooCommerce (reports, SKU tracking, etc) and apply those specifically to tickets. Whether soliciting free RSVPs to a community gathering or hosting a huge party with multiple price tiers, WooCommerce Tickets has got you covered.

If you're new to The Events Calendar, you may want to check out our <a href="http://m.tri.be/1i">new user primer.</a> We've also got additional premium upgrades that let you create recurring events, sell tickets, manage conference schedules, accept user submitted events, create custom fields, and even integrate with Facebook. You can check out our <a href="http://m.tri.be/1j">available premium and community add-ons here</a>.

Remember that this plugin also requires WooCommerce, which you can download (for free) <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/?ref=tribe-events">from WooThemes.</a>

= The Events Calendar: WooCommerce Tickets =

* Sell tickets to events directly within the event listings. You can control the branding, look and feel to be consistent with your site's appearance.
* Set different price tiers, limit the number of tickets available and select timeframes for when tickets are available/unavailable.
* Generate reports (courtesy of WooCommerce) on an event-wide or ticket-specific basis.
* Send PDF tickets to purchases which they can print out and bring to the door at your event.
